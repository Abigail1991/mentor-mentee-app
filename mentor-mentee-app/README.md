Mentor Mentee App

ðŸŒŸ Inspiration
My passion for mentorship inspired the creation of this app. I love mentoring young individuals and frequently participate in career development and mentorship programs. However, I often lose touch with my mentees after these events. This app aims to bridge that gap, helping mentees who need guidance and mentors who want to support the next generation in their career progression. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
